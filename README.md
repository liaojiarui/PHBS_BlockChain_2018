### Abstract
Chinese game industry grows slowly, demographic dividend disappears gradually.With the development of blockchain technology and the construction of the overall environment, blockchain games are rapidly promoted.Blockchain games are games developed based on blockchain technology and decentralized operation.Blockchain games can convince users of the fairness and impartiality of games by virtue of the open, transparent and non-tampering advantages of blockchain.Like the early mobile games, blockchain games are mostly faced with problems such as insufficient user base and weak playability.This paper starts with the current situation of the game industry and analyzes the differences between traditional electronic games and blockchain games based on several representative blockchain games, and finally gives reasonable development suggestions.

### 1. Domestic game industry development status

The past year of 2018 has been an extraordinary year for China's game industry. According to the industry report released by China's game industry commission, the actual sales revenue of China's game market in 2018 reached 214.44 billion yuan.However, during the period from 2008 to 2017, the market sales revenue of the game industry has maintained above 15% growth, while in 2018, the market sales revenue of the game industry is only 5.3%, which is a record low for a decade. This also means that the current game industry bid farewell to the past high growth stage, the industry needs to find new growth points.

In terms of game user scale, according to data from the China games industry committee, the number of game users in China was 530 million in the first six months of 2018, up only 4% year-on-year.In fact, since 2010, the growth of Chinese game users has been gradually slowing down, from 62.5% in the first half of 2010 to 4% in the first half of 2018.These are signs that the game market is saturated and the demographic dividend is fading.

### 2. The application of blockchain technology in the game industry

With the domestic market slowing down and the regulatory policies gradually tightening, many game companies have begun to seek new growth points.In late 2017, a game called CryptoKitties became globally popular.The pet development game, which is based on ethereum's smart contract, was worth more than $1.9 million within seven days of its launch, triggering a traffic jam on ethereum's network.The success of Cryptokittiesh has attracted the attention of global capital and companies.A month later, AxiomZen, the studio that developed CryptoKitties, completed A $70 million series A funding round.Domestic Internet companies such as xiaomi, xunlei, netease, baidu and 360 have launched their own blockchain games such as cat raising, dog raising and rabbit raising at the beginning of 2018. Blockchain games have become popular rapidly.
So what are the application advantages of blockchain technology in the game industry?
First, blockchain games rely on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional games, which are controlled by manufacturers, blockchain games are driven by the community. The rules of the game are determined by pre-written smart contract codes, and developers have no right to change them.
Second, in blockchain games, users are both participants in the game and sharers of the game's future revenue.In traditional games, the ownership of virtual assets (game equipment, skin, coupons, etc.) in the game does not actually belong to the user, but belongs to the game manufacturer. The transaction of game assets between users is not allowed.In blockchain games, the ownership of property rights is defined, and game assets can be freely traded between users. With the growth of game value, the value of equipment and virtual game coin will also increase, from which users can obtain benefits.In this way, users become stakeholders of the game instead of receivers of the game, increasing user stickiness. Small and medium-sized game developers will also have their own loyal fans and traffic.
Finally, through the decentralized and open and transparent features of blockchain technology, the openness and fairness of game mechanism can be realized.In traditional game projects, game manufacturers have absolute dominance. When game manufacturers change game rules, users can only choose to accept passively. In addition, many numerical algorithms in the game are not transparent, which cannot guarantee fairness in the game.In blockchain games, users can choose to implement hard fork to refuse to accept the game manufacturer's change of rules. Even further, the player can become the game's developer to make the rules and develop the game, which can be determined by the community vote, which can bring better game experience and higher game loyalty to the blockchain games.
