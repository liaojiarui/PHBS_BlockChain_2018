### Abstract
Chinese game industry grows slowly, demographic dividend disappears gradually.With the development of blockchain technology and the construction of the overall environment, blockchain games are rapidly promoted.Blockchain games are games developed based on blockchain technology and decentralized operation.Blockchain games can convince users of the fairness and impartiality of games by virtue of the open, transparent and non-tampering advantages of blockchain.Like the early mobile games, blockchain games are mostly faced with problems such as insufficient user base and weak playability.This paper starts with the current situation of the game industry and analyzes the differences between traditional electronic games and blockchain games based on several representative blockchain games, and finally gives reasonable development suggestions.

### 1. Domestic game industry development status

The past year of 2018 has been an extraordinary year for China's game industry. According to the industry report released by China's game industry commission, the actual sales revenue of China's game market in 2018 reached 214.44 billion yuan.However, during the period from 2008 to 2017, the market sales revenue of the game industry has maintained above 15% growth, while in 2018, the market sales revenue of the game industry is only 5.3%, which is a record low for a decade. This also means that the current game industry bid farewell to the past high growth stage, the industry needs to find new growth points.

In terms of game user scale, according to data from the China games industry committee, the number of game users in China was 530 million in the first six months of 2018, up only 4% year-on-year.In fact, since 2010, the growth of Chinese game users has been gradually slowing down, from 62.5% in the first half of 2010 to 4% in the first half of 2018.These are signs that the game market is saturated and the demographic dividend is fading.

### 2. The application of blockchain technology in the game industry

With the domestic market slowing down and the regulatory policies gradually tightening, many game companies have begun to seek new growth points.In late 2017, a game called CryptoKitties became globally popular.The pet development game, which is based on ethereum's smart contract, was worth more than $1.9 million within seven days of its launch, triggering a traffic jam on ethereum's network.The success of Cryptokittiesh has attracted the attention of global capital and companies.A month later, AxiomZen, the studio that developed CryptoKitties, completed A $70 million series A funding round.Domestic Internet companies such as xiaomi, xunlei, netease, baidu and 360 have launched their own blockchain games such as cat raising, dog raising and rabbit raising at the beginning of 2018. Blockchain games have become popular rapidly.
So what are the application advantages of blockchain technology in the game industry?
First, blockchain games rely on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional games, which are controlled by manufacturers, blockchain games are driven by the community. The rules of the game are determined by pre-written smart contract codes, and developers have no right to change them.
Second, in blockchain games, users are both participants in the game and sharers of the game's future revenue.In traditional games, the ownership of virtual assets (game equipment, skin, coupons, etc.) in the game does not actually belong to the user, but belongs to the game manufacturer. The transaction of game assets between users is not allowed.In blockchain games, the ownership of property rights is defined, and game assets can be freely traded between users. With the growth of game value, the value of equipment and virtual game coin will also increase, from which users can obtain benefits.In this way, users become stakeholders of the game instead of receivers of the game, increasing user stickiness. Small and medium-sized game developers will also have their own loyal fans and traffic.
Finally, through the decentralized and open and transparent features of blockchain technology, the openness and fairness of game mechanism can be realized.In traditional game projects, game manufacturers have absolute dominance. When game manufacturers change game rules, users can only choose to accept passively. In addition, many numerical algorithms in the game are not transparent, which cannot guarantee fairness in the game.In blockchain games, users can choose to implement hard fork to refuse to accept the game manufacturer's change of rules. Even further, the player can become the game's developer to make the rules and develop the game, which can be determined by the community vote, which can bring better game experience and higher game loyalty to the blockchain games.

### 3. Blockchain game development status
#### 3.1 Introduction to blockchain games

At the end of 2017, people saw the potential of blockchain games in the future due to the hot status of Cryptokitties, and then 2018 became the first year of the rise of blockchain games.According to statistics from DAppReview, the total transaction volume of blockchain games in 2018 reached 33.6 billion yuan, with over 100 new blockchain games added every month on average.In the second half of 2018, the market size of blockchain games will usher in a new round of growth with the launch of EOS and TRON.Currently, in terms of the market, EOS and TRON, two large public chain communities, occupy the majority of the market share of blockchain games with the advantages of zero commission fee, high TPS and generous developer rewards.

At present, blockchain games are mainly divided into seven categories, namely, cultivation, guessing, RPG, simulation operation, sandbox, placement and strategy, of which cultivation, guessing and simulation operation are the main ones.The nurture-type blockchain games are mainly for players to cultivate specific objects (characters or pets, etc.) in the game, and they can reproduce and trade.Guessing games are mainly board games and gambling games developed on the blockchain.Simulated business games simulate the real society. Players manage and buy and sell virtual world, such as virtual companies and virtual real estate.

In terms of the current development level of blockchain technology, blockchain games are most likely to be applied in board games and gambling games on a large scale. By virtue of the open, transparent and tamper-proof advantages of blockchain, users can be convinced of the fairness and impartiality of games.In fact, according to data on DAppRadar's website, as of January 2019, most of the top ten projects on Ethereym, EOS and TRON's three mainstream public chain dapps were betting games based on weekly transaction volume. This is not only because of the good characteristics of smart contracts, but also because the main users of current blockchain games are mainly speculative groups.

##### 3.1.1 Blockchain cryptographic pet games (nurseries)

The first popular CryptoKitties game was a pet-forming game that included cat breeding, collection, purchase and sales.Each cat is personally owned by the user and is not controlled by the game developer.ETH allows anyone in the world to buy a virtual cat, and users need only two different cats to breed and give birth to a new cat.These cats can continue to breed or be sold in the market.
Encryption games there were 100 "creation" cat cat, every 15 minutes there is a new generation of zero cat was born, it's cost is equivalent to the latest sold five cats average price increased by 50%, again on the basis of but if no one buys, sells will begin to decline, until the people to buy, so the cat's price is also according to the market for dynamic adjustment.
Crypto cats have a 256-bit genome, and cats with different sequences of gene combinations are different, so newborn kittens with different combinations of gene sequences will show different characteristics.To ensure value, the new combinations also take into account rarity, ensuring that some gene sequences are relatively rare, so cats with rare genetic traits will be sold at a premium.

Since CryptoKitties became popular worldwide, xiaomi, xunlei, netease, baidu, 360 and other Internet companies have launched their own blockchain games of cat, dog and rabbit raising.However, the main factor for the popularity of such blockchain pet games is the speculative motivation of users. The genetic characteristics of kittens produced by two cats are highly random, which is similar to the lottery game with gambling nature. The price of pet cats is not controlled by the official game, so there is room for price speculation.This kind of mild games generally have the problems of single form, entertainment and lack of experience. When the novelty of the game to the public declines and the speculative enthusiasm weakens, the emerging blockchain pet cultivation game will have the phenomenon of weak attraction, decreased daily activity and user loss.

##### 3.1.2 Fomo3D games (Quizzes gambling series)
In July 2018, a blockchain game named Fmo3D began to appear on ethereum network, and a large number of players swarmed into the game within one day, resulting in a large number of traffic jams on ethereum network.Fomo3D is a kind of gambling games, whose rules are relatively simple.At the beginning of each game, the player can spend ETH from ethereum wallet to buy the KEY.As long as the user is the last to buy the KEY and keeps the price for 24 hours, all ETH's in the prize pool belong to the user.On the basis of this rule, Fmo3D also added flash shooting system, bonus system, clan system and other new functions, increasing the playability of the game.On July 16, Fomo3D collected more than 2.13 million ETH in the bonus pool, with a total value of more than 60 million RMB, according to the report of lianda APP.

In essence, Fomo3D is a typical "capital pool + gambling" blockchain game.It mainly makes use of players' greed and speculative psychology, and makes people engage in it through specially designed token incentive mechanism.In fact, Fomo3D was open to this from the beginning, with lexitscamme as the domain name of the game and Bad Advices as the button to invite friends, which was provocative.Users who are involved know this, but everyone wants to be the last to buy and take all the winnings.
But the result was unexpected: Fomo3D's first game ended in August, and "EH," worth 20 million yuan, was accessed by a hacker with a special strategy.The hacker used his smart contract to send large amounts of high-priced transactions to ethereum's network.Because italf miners' strategy of packing blocks was high fee first, this player's extremely high fee prevented other players from purchasing KEY in Fomo3D game, thus making him the ultimate winner.

##### 3.1.3 EOS Knights (PRG)
EOS Knights is an RPG game developed by Korean studio BADA.In terms of the experience, players are required to register an EOS account and a scatter wallet account, then purchase a hero and equipment in the game, followed by the traditional loot mode.But unlike the one-way flow of equipment purchases in traditional games, the flow of equipment in this game is two-way: users can sell game equipment for EOS.

EOS Knights is one of the blockchain games with high playability.Therefore, in the field of blockchain games, where gambling and guessing games are popular, this game can often occupy the top ten positions in terms of game activity, and the number of users and transaction volume are also gradually increasing.

### 3.2 Features of the current phase of blockchain games
Despite the promising future of blockchain games, blockchain games are still in the early stage of development, and large-scale games cannot be developed on blockchain. In addition, both users and the market need to further popularize blockchain games.
From the perspective of players and users, the current players of blockchain games are mainly "coin circle" users. The purpose of playing games is mainly speculation and speculation, and the number of users for the purpose of game entertainment is not high.From the perspective of daily activity, according to the data of DAppRadar website in early January, the highest daily activity of EOS Knights was only 5,400 users per day, far less than the average daily users of traditional online games.

Rank | The project name | Type | Public Chain | 24h Number of users | 24h volume (ten thousand dollars) | 24h Transaction number (ten thousand times)    
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |------------ |------------ |------------
1 | PRA CandyBOX | other | EOS | 11400 | 0 | 4
2 | EOS Knights | PRG | EOS | 5400 | 1.5 | 36.1
3 | ENBank | other | EOS | 4000 | 0 | 212.1
4 | TRONbet | lottery | TRON | 3500 | 1840 | 17.4
5 | EOS Bet | lottery | EOS | 2900 | 43.22 | 448.1
6 | FarmEOS | lottery | EOS | 2700 | 260 | 163.7
7 | Fishing Master | lottery | 2400 | 18.83 | 10.5
8 | Fastwin | lottery | EOS | 2300 | 690 | 23.9
9 | ALLBET-Presale | lottery | TRON | 2300 | 88.44 | 406.5
10 | Game Sky | lottery | EOS | 2000 | 0.29| 59.1

From the perspective of game quality, the categories of blockchain games are relatively simple at present, most of which are gambling and capital game, with weak playability, poor user experience, poor UI interface and short life cycle of games.As for the CryptoKitties mentioned above, according to the data from the DAppRadar website, in December 2017, it had more than 10,000 daily users and an average daily trading volume of more than 5,000 EH(worth 45 million RMB at that time).But after January 2018, both the number of daily users and the transaction volume of the game declined rapidly.By January 2019, the number of its daily users is only more than 200, and the daily transaction volume is only 28EH(worth about 20,000 RMB).In fact, long-term tracking of game-like dapps on Ethereum, EOS and TRON shows that a typical blockchain game has a life cycle of only about two weeks.
From the perspective of law, Token economy model is generally included in blockchain games.However, the supervision of digital currency in China is gradually tightening. Most of the blockchain games are gambling and capital game, which will be strictly regulated by the government in the future.
